General:
========
- For the code section we will expect a working code. 
- For the design, go ahead and write a doc/pdf whatever you are comfortable with, and try to be clear and use simple explanations.
- You are allowed to use 3rd party tools for the challenge


Code Section:
=============
- Create a python package for this simple application
- Create a docker for the app that will import the python package
- Create a script/docker to application test
- Create a Kubernetes / ECS / SWARM that will run the application - explain what you chose and why (provide only the config files and a print screen that shows that it's running)

Design: write a suggestion - NO NEED FOR IMPLEMENTATION
===========================
- Monitoring: How will you monitor this application
- Scale: Lets say you need to scale this to 1M request per second - suggest the architecture of the solution going into production
- Test: suggest ways of making sure the app can take the scale
- Versioning: how will you maintain a versioning mechanism for the app
- Alternatives: If you had the power to influence whatever you want and still keep this functionality, what would you do ?
